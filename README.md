Ruru Theme is a custom VSCode theme designed to bring a unique and refreshing look to your coding environment.

In the first image, as you can see, the theme looks a bit transparent because I use another extension called [Glassit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=s-nlf-fh.glassit).
To achieve this effect, just add the following configuration to your `settings.json` file:

```json
{
  "glassit.alpha": 245,
  "glassit.step": 0,
  "glassit.force_sway": true,
}
```
